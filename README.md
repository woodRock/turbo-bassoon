GitHub Actions are an important part of Continuous Integration and Development. They can be used to automate tasks in our workflow. GitHub allows us to create our own actions, and even release them to the market place to be reused easily by others. In this repository, we create a custom GitHub Action which sends a "Thank You" message with a related GIF, after a pull request has been made to a repository. An action of this nature would be useful for open-source projects, to show consideration towards contributors.
